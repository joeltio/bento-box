    """Compiles the given `convert_fn` into a computation Graph.

    Compiles by converting the given `convert_fn` function to AST
    applying the given `preprocessors` transforms to perform preprocessing on the AST,
    applying given `analyzers` on the AST to perform static analysis,
    linting the AST with the given `linters` to perform static checks,
    applying the given `transforms` to transform the AST to a function that plots the computational graph.

    Note:
        Even though both `preprocessors` and `transforms` are comprised of  a list of `Transform`s
        `preprocessors` transforms are applied before any static analysis is done while
        `transforms` are applied after static analysis. This allows `preprocessors` to focus
        on transforming the AST to make static analysis easier while `transforms` to focus on
        transforming the AST to plot a computation graph.

    The transformed AST is converted back to source where it can be imported
    to provide a compiled function that builds the graph using the given `Plotter` on call.
    The graph obtained from the `Plotter` is finally returned.

    The analyzers and transforms that should be used should be preconfigured.
    Users should simply annotate the function they want converted with `@compile_graph`

        Example:
        @compile_graph
        def car_pos_graph(g: Plotter):
            car = g.entity(
                components=[
                    "position",
                ]
            )
            env = g.entity(components=["clock"])
            x_delta = 20 if env["clock"].tick_ms > 2000 else 10
            car["position"].x = x_delta

        # use compiled graph 'car_pos_graph' in code ...

    Args:
        convert_fn: Target function containing the source to convert to the computation graph.
            The function should take in one parameter: a `Plotter` instance which
            allows users to access graphing specific operations. Must be a plain Python
            Function, not a Callable class, method, classmethod or staticmethod.

        preprocessors: List of `Transform`s that are run sequentially to apply
            preprocesssing transforms to the AST before any static analysis is done.
            Typically these AST transforms make static analysis easier by simplifying the AST.

        analyzers: List of `Analyzer`s that are run sequentially on the AST perform
            static analysis.  Analyzers can add attributes to AST nodes but not
            modify the AST tree.

        linters: List of `Linter`s that are run sequentially on the AST to perform
            static checks on the convertability of the AST. `Linter`s are expected
            to throw exception when failing a check.

        transforms: List of `Transform`s that are run sequentially to transform the
            AST to a compiled function (in AST form) that builds the computation
            graph when called.

    Returns:
        The converted computational Graph as a `Graph` protobuf message.
